	abstract = {Starting from where a first course in convex optimization leaves off, this text presents a unified analysis of first-order optimization methods – including parallel-distributed algorithms – through the abstraction of monotone operators. With the increased computational power and availability of big data over the past decade, applied disciplines have demanded that larger and larger optimization problems be solved. This text covers the first-order convex optimization methods that are uniquely effective at solving these large-scale optimization problems. Readers will have the opportunity to construct and analyze many well-known classical and modern algorithms using monotone operators, and walk away with a solid understanding of the diverse optimization algorithms. Graduate students and researchers in mathematical optimization, operations research, electrical engineering, statistics, and computer science will appreciate this concise introduction to the theory of convex optimization algorithms.},

	abstract = {We study a first-order primal-dual algorithm for convex optimization problems with known saddle-point structure. We prove convergence to a saddle-point with rate O(1/N) in finite dimensions, which is optimal for the complete class of non-smooth problems we are considering in this paper. We further show accelerations of the proposed algorithm to yield optimal rates on easier problems. In particular we show that we can achieve O(1/N²) convergence on problems, where the primal or the dual objective is uniformly convex, and we can show linear convergence, i.e. O(1/e{\textasciicircum}N) on problems where both are uniformly convex. The wide applicability of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated on several imaging problems such as image denoising, image deconvolution, image inpainting, motion estimation and image segmentation.},
